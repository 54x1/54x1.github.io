            <h2>Robin Boyd</h2>
            <p>
              Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and internationally renowned architect. He was also widely published and appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the
              practice of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, the firm maintained a strong design unity. Some buildings revealed the hand of one or other of the architects, but in general the firm developed a corporate style, combining the
              philosophies of the trio and representing the advanced thinking of that era. They often worked or supervised on each otherâ€™s projects. Their work was a distinctive Australian form of the International Style, then called Contemporary.
              (Clerehan, 1993)

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on
              Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.
            </p>
            <p>
              The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust. Features of the original design included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust;
              </li>
              <li>
                the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace; and
              </li>
              <li>
                accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar and kitchen.
