            <h2>Robin Boyd</h2>
            <p>
              Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and internationally renowned architect. He was also widely published and appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the
              practice of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, the firm maintained a strong design unity. Some buildings revealed the hand of one or other of the architects, but in general the firm developed a corporate style, combining the
              philosophies of the trio and representing the advanced thinking of that era. They often worked or supervised on each other’s projects. Their work was a distinctive Australian form of the International Style, then called Contemporary.
              (Clerehan, 1993)
            </p>
            <p>
              In the 1960s he started to move away from the glass box functionalism of the International and Melbourne Regional styles arguing that it had a limited range of expression and instead tried, somewhat unsuccessfully, to land large prestigious commissions for advanced high-rise buildings. He submitted many designs, but few were successful. Those that he did win tended to be of a more moderate size, such as the Menzies College at La Trobe University or Churchill House. Taylor (1990:80) notes that Boyd’s interest in Brutalism was heavily influenced by his travels in Japan and he became known as the chief advocate in Australia for the “vigorous, concrete buildings of post-war Japan”, but goes on to note that his own attempts at major Brutalist designs show “...a somewhat crude, unexpressive, Brutalist aesthetic.

            <p>
              Churchill House was built by the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia. The Trust began consideration of erecting a building of its own in 1967 and formed a building committee in 1968. In 1969 it acquired a lease for land on
              Northbourne Avenue, the current site, and engaged the architect Robin Boyd to design the building.
            </p>
            <p>
              The building was to provide offices for the Trust and in addition was to provide rental office accommodation for commercial tenants as a means of generating income for the Trust. Features of the original design included:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                a glass exhibition pavilion, on the site of the current north wing, which housed a display on the work of the Trust;
              </li>
              <li>
                the flat roof area of the east and south wings which was intended to be a roof terrace; and
              </li>
              <li>
                accommodation in the building included a board room, dining room, reception area, bar and kitchen.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The cost of the works was about $1 million. The building was officially opened on 14 April 1972.<br>
              Boyd died in 1971 before completion, and W K Williams was engaged by the Trust as its site representative to replace Boyd.
            </p>
            <p>
              Robin Boyd CBE HFRAIA (1919-1971) is a noted Australian architect. Boyd was a member of a prominent artistic family, and combined a career as an architect, author and critic (Clerehan 1993). He was strongly influenced by the Modern Movement, and deeply interested in the development of Australian architecture. Boyd is often remembered best for his domestic architecture, as well as his books, but he also produced designs for larger scale works, such as in the case of Churchill House. Boyd was awarded the Gold Medal by the RAIA in 1969, and made an honorary fellow in 1970.

              Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style, (1960-), displaying several key features as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition, it displays a number of the other features of this style including: sloping structural fins, precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House is one
              of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.
            </p>
            <p>
              The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.

            </p>
            <p>
              Several components make up the complex. The main building, with east and south wings; the separate north wing or pavilion; the central pool and a rear carpark. The main building forms an L shape and with the north wing it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The main building is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The north wing and the carpark are two storeyed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style: Cameron Offices, National Gallery of Australia and High Court of Australia.
