          <h2>Robin Boyd</h2>
          <p>
            Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd (1919-1971) was a nationally and internationally renowned architect. He was also widely published and appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the
            practice of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, the firm maintained a strong design unity. Some buildings revealed the hand of one or other of the architects, but in general the firm developed a corporate style, combining the
            philosophies of the trio and representing the advanced thinking of that era. They often worked or supervised on each otherâ€™s projects. Their work was a distinctive Australian form of the International Style, then called Contemporary.
            (Clerehan, 1993)
